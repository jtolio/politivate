after initial clone and after any changes to the static
resources directory:

  export GOPATH=$(pwd)
  go generate politivate.org/web/...

just checking everything compiles:

  export GOPATH=$(pwd)
  go install -v politivate.org/web/app/local && bin/local

running locally:

  export GOPATH=$(pwd)
  $GO_APPENGINE_ROOT/goapp serve politivate.org/web/app/appengine

deploying:

  export GOPATH=$(pwd)
  $GO_APPENGINE_ROOT/goapp deploy politivate.org/web/app/appengine
