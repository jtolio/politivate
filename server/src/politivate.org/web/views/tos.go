<h1>Terms of Service</h1>

<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of Politivate
("Politivate", "we" or "our") websites, services, and applications
(collectively the "Service"). Your access to and use of the Service is
conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms
apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.</p>

<h3>Your use of the service</h3>

<p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If
you are using the Services on behalf of an organization or entity
("Organization"), then you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that
Organization and you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind
the Organization to these Terms. In that case, "you" and "your" refers to you
and that Organization.</p>

<p>You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with
Politivate, and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local,
state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations. The Service
may change from time to time as we evolve, refine, or add more features to the
Service, often without prior notice to you. In addition, Politivate may
temporarily or permanently stop providing the Service, or any features within
the Service, to you or to users generally and may not be able to provide you
with prior notice.</p>

<h3>Your content</h3>

<p>Some areas of the Service allow you to post or upload information, text,
graphics, or other material ("Content" or, when posted by you, "your Content"),
and to share your Content with others. You retain ownership of your Content,
but there are many things that users may do with your Content, for example,
copy it, modify it, re-share it, or broadcast it. Politivate has no
responsibility for that activity. You understand that publishing your Content
on the Service is not a substitute for registering it with the U.S. Copyright
Office, the Writers Guild of America, or any other rights organization.
Please consider carefully what you choose to share.</p>

<p>You agree not to post Content that (i) may create a risk of harm, loss,
physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability,
disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to
any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or
property; (iii) seeks to harm or exploit children by exposing them to
inappropriate content, asking for personally identifiable details or otherwise;
(iv) may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort; (v) contains any
information or content that we deem to be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially
or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy
or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or
otherwise), libelous, threatening, profane, or otherwise objectionable; (vi)
contains any information or content that is illegal (including, without
limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of
another party's trade secrets); (vii) contains any information or content that
you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or
fiduciary relationships; or (viii) contains any information or content that you
know is not correct and current. You agree that any Content that you post does
not and will not violate rights of any kind, including without limitation any
intellectual property rights or rights of privacy. We reserve the right` +

	//`, but
	//are not obligated, to reject and/or remove any Content that we believe, in our
	//sole discretion, violates these provisions.`
	` to remove any Content at any time.` +

	`</p>

<p>You retain full ownership to your Content, but you agree to grant us a
worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, transferable, perpetual, royalty-free
license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt,
modify, publish, transmit, edit, translate, make derivatives, display, and
distribute such Content in connection with providing the Service to you and
other users in accordance with your settings on the Service. In connection with
providing the Service, we may modify or adapt your Content in order to
transmit, display or distribute it over computer networks and in various media
and/or make changes to your Content as are necessary to conform and adapt that
Content to any requirements or limitations of any networks, devices, services,
or media.</p>

<p>We reserve the right at all times, but are not obligated, to remove or
refuse to distribute any Content on the Service including your Content. We also
reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we
reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation,
legal process, or governmental request; (ii) enforce the Terms, including
investigation of potential violations; (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise
address fraud, security, or technical issues; (iv) respond to user support
requests; or (v) protect the rights, property, or safety of Politivate, its
users, and the public.</p>

<h3>Your account</h3>

<p>You must provide us accurate information when you create your Politivate
account. Your Politivate account gives you access to the Services and
functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our
sole discretion. We may maintain different types of accounts for different
types of users or organizations. If you connect to Politivate with a
third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information
from that service as permitted by that service. You may never use another
user's account without permission.</p>

<h3>Account security</h3>

<p>You are responsible for safeguarding your credentials that you use to access
the Service and for any activities or actions under your account, whether your
account is with Politivate or a third-party service. We encourage you to use
long passwords that are multiple unrelated words in length and not use the same
password for different services. Politivate cannot and will not be liable for
any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above
requirements. You must notify Politivate immediately upon becoming aware of any
breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

<h3>Politivate's license to you</h3>

<p>Subject to these Terms, Politivate gives you a personal, worldwide,
royalty-free, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, and non-exclusive license to
use the Service. We reserve all rights not expressly granted in these Terms in
the Service. We can terminate this license at any time for any reason or for no
reason.</p>

<p>We may make available software to access the Service via a mobile device
("Mobile Software"). To use the Mobile Software you must have a mobile device
that is compatible with the Mobile Service. We do not warrant that the Mobile
Software will be compatible with your mobile device. We give you a
non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use a compiled code copy
of the Mobile Software for one account on one mobile device owned or leased
solely by you, for your personal use. You may not (i) modify, disassemble,
decompile, or reverse engineer the Mobile Software, except to the extent that
such restriction is expressly prohibited by law; (ii) rent, lease, loan,
resell, sublicense, distribute, or otherwise transfer the Mobile Software to
any third party or use the Mobile Software to provide time sharing or similar
services for any third party; (iii) make any copies of the Mobile Software;
(iv) remove, circumvent, disable, damage, or otherwise interfere with
security-related features of the Mobile Software, features that prevent or
restrict use or copying of any content accessible through the Mobile Software,
or features that enforce limitations on use of the Mobile Software; or (v)
delete the copyright and other proprietary rights notices on the Mobile
Software. You agree that we may from time to time issue upgraded versions of
the Mobile Software, and may automatically electronically upgrade the version
of the Mobile Software that you are using on your mobile device. You agree to
the automatic upgrading on your mobile device, and agree that the terms and
conditions of these Terms will apply to any upgrades. Any third-party code that
may be incorporated in the Mobile Software is covered by the applicable open
source or third-party license EULA, if any, authorizing use of such code. This
license is not a sale of the Mobile Software or any copy thereof, and
Politivate or its third-party partners or suppliers retain all right, title,
and interest in the Mobile Software (and any copy thereof). We reserve all
rights not expressly granted under these Terms. If the Mobile Software is being
acquired on behalf of the United States Government, then the following
